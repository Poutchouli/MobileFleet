# "My Tickets" Feature Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new "My Tickets" page in the Manager Portal that allows managers to view all tickets they have submitted. The feature includes secure API endpoints, dedicated navigation, and a responsive interface.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. Backend Routes Added (`app.py`)

#### **Manager Tickets Page Route**
```python
@app.route('/manager/tickets')
@login_required
@role_required('Manager')
def manager_tickets():
    """Serves the page for a manager to view their submitted tickets."""
    return render_template('manager/tickets.html')
```

#### **Manager Tickets API Endpoint**
```python
@app.route('/api/manager/tickets', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
@role_required('Manager')
def get_manager_tickets():
    """API endpoint to get all tickets submitted by the current manager."""
    # Securely fetches only tickets created by the logged-in manager
    # Returns ticket details with phone and worker information
```

### 2. Template Structure Created

#### **Manager Base Template** (`templates/manager/base.html`)
- Extends the main base template
- Provides consistent navigation for manager portal
- Includes "Dashboard" and "My Tickets" navigation links
- Highlights active page based on current route

#### **My Tickets Page** (`templates/manager/tickets.html`)
- Responsive table displaying ticket history
- Shows: ID, Priority, Title, Worker, Phone Asset, Status, Date Created
- Dynamic priority badges with color coding
- Empty state message when no tickets exist
- Real-time data fetching via JavaScript

### 3. Navigation Integration

#### **Updated Manager Dashboard** (`templates/manager/dashboard.html`)
- Changed base template from `base.html` to `manager/base.html`
- Now includes the new navigation sidebar
- Maintains all existing functionality

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- Both page route and API endpoint use `@role_required('Manager')`
- Only managers can access their tickets page
- API endpoint validates user session before serving data

### **Manager Isolation**
- SQL query filters tickets by `reported_by_manager_id = current_user_id`
- Managers can only see tickets they personally submitted
- No cross-manager data leakage possible

### **SQL Injection Protection**
- Parameterized queries using `%s` placeholders
- User input properly escaped through psycopg2

## 📊 Database Query Details

The API endpoint executes this secure query:
```sql
SELECT 
    t.id AS ticket_id,
    t.title,
    t.status,
    t.priority,
    t.created_at,
    p.asset_tag AS phone_asset_tag,
    w.full_name AS worker_name
FROM tickets t
JOIN phones p ON t.phone_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN assignments a ON p.id = a.phone_id AND a.return_date IS NULL
LEFT JOIN workers w ON a.worker_id = w.id
WHERE t.reported_by_manager_id = %s
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;
```

## 🎨 User Interface Features

## 🔧 Technical Integration

### **Consistent Architecture**

- Compatible with RealDictCursor for dictionary-like results

### **Error Handling**
- JavaScript catches API fetch errors
- Displays user-friendly error messages
- Graceful handling of empty ticket lists
- Console logging for debugging

### **Data Processing**
- Automatic datetime conversion to ISO format
- JSON serialization for API responses
- Client-side date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
